  "summary": "The architecture is well-designed and follows many AWS best practices. However, there are opportunities to optimize costs for AI inference, reduce database latency, and improve reliability by implementing failover for the Bedrock AI service.",

  "architecture_description": "Next.js 14 frontend deployed on Vercel with server components and edge caching. TypeScript strict mode for full type safety. FastAPI backend on Railway with Python 3.11 and async request handling. AWS Bedrock for AI analysis using Claude 3.5 Haiku with inference profile (~$0.001/review) and Claude 3 Sonnet for image vision analysis (~$0.012/image). Inline AWS Well-Architected context (~6K tokens) passed with every request, no Knowledge Base retrieval. Neo4j AuraDB free tier knowledge graph with async background writes (non-blocking, 200-500ms latency). Graph stores 31 reviews, 20 AWS services, 72 findings with relationships (HAS_FINDING, INVOLVES_SERVICE, CO_OCCURS_WITH). HTTPS everywhere with TLS 1.3. CORS whitelist for tesseric.ca and api.tesseric.ca origins only. IAM roles for AWS Bedrock access, no hardcoded access keys. Environment variables stored in Railway secrets. GitHub Actions CI/CD with pytest backend tests and TypeScript compilation checks. Docker containerization for backend with multi-stage builds. Pydantic v2 for request/response validation. Zero data persistence for architecture descriptions (ephemeral sessions, immediate discard). Metrics endpoint with 5-minute caching. Processing time tracking in Neo4j Analysis nodes. Average response time 8.0 seconds. Graceful fallback to pattern matching if Bedrock unavailable."
